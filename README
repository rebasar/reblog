# reblog: The blog engine for my very specific needs.

reblog is a blog engine I wrote mostly for learning
Scala/Play/ReactiveMongo. It did not take me a year to write but I did
give a long break to development.

## Features

- Uses MongoDB as backend (insert NoSQL joke here)
- Allows you to use multiple tags and filter your articles based on
  these tags. (Wow, it's almost like 1999)
- Supports articles in multiple languages (Currently limited to
  Turkish and English, you are welcome to hack in the support for
  more)
- Supports entries in multiple formats (HTML, Markdown,
  ReStructuredText)
- Does not include a single line of Javascript
- Does not include any cookies, session etc...

## Unfeatures

- Does not have any way of inserting new articles (I was too lazy for
  that)
- Does not provide a way of serving static content (images etc...) but
  you should be using a normal web server for that kind of stuff
  anyway.
- Does not provide a simple way of customizing the looks (you need to
  change the less file and rebuild the app for that)

This project is by no means complete or *ready for production use* and
it probably will never be. I use it to run my own blog and if you like
it you might want to give it a try too.
